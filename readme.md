Weather Web Application

This repository contains the source code for a Weather Web Application developed during my Web Development internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The application provides real-time weather updates based on the user's location or a user-inputted location, offering a clean and interactive interface to display essential weather details.

Features :-

•	Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches weather information using a reliable weather API.

•	Location-Based Updates: Automatically detects the user's location for weather updates.

•	User Input Support: Allows users to search for weather information by entering a city or location.

•	Interactive UI: Displays weather conditions, temperature, and other details in an intuitive layout.

•	Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing across various devices.


Technologies Used :-

•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

•	API Integration: OpenWeatherMap API


How It Works :-


1.	The application uses JavaScript to fetch data from a weather API based on the user's geolocation or input.
	
2.	The weather data is processed and displayed in an organized, user-friendly format
	
3.	Additional details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions are dynamically updated.
